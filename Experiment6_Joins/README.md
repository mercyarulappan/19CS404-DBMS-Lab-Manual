# Experiment 6: Joins

## NAME: MERCY A
## REG NO: 212223110027

## AIM
To study and implement different types of joins.

## THEORY

SQL Joins are used to combine records from two or more tables based on a related column.

### 1. INNER JOIN
Returns records with matching values in both tables.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

### 2. LEFT JOIN
Returns all records from the left table, and matched records from the right.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```
### 3. RIGHT JOIN
Returns all records from the right table, and matched records from the left.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```
### 4. FULL OUTER JOIN
Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

**Question 1**

From the following tables write a SQL query to find the details of an order. Return ord_no, ord_date, purch_amt, Customer Name, grade, Salesman, commission. 

Sample table: orders

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/923613e4-50bf-422b-bf64-005ccb658f7d)

select o.ord_no,

o.ord_date,

o.purch_amt,

c.cust_name as 'Customer Name',


c.grade,

s.name as Salesman,

s.commission

from orders as o

join customer c on o.customer_id=c.customer_id

join salesman s on o.salesman_id=s.salesman_id;


**Output:**

**Question 3**

Write the SQL query that achieves the selection of the first name from the "patients" table (aliased as "patient_name") and the first name from the "doctors" table (aliased as "doctor_name"), with an inner join on the "doctor_id" column and a condition filtering for patients with a null discharge date.

select p.first_name as "patient_name",d.first_name as doctor_name

from patients p

inner join doctors d on p.doctor_id=d.doctor_id

where p.discharge_date is null;

**Output:**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce45e882-539a-44c5-8506-9ab6dc1076f2)

select s.name

where c.city='New York';


**Output:**

**Question 5**

From the following tables write a SQL query to display the customer name, customer city, grade, salesman, salesman city. The results should be sorted by ascending customer_id.  

Sample table: customer

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82b016b3-f1cd-4892-b9ce-c2b7bb414d77)

select c.cust_name,

c.city,

c.grade,

s.name AS Salesman,

s.city 

from customer c

join salesman as s ON s.salesman_id=c.salesman_id

order by customer_id ASC;


**Output:**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3de8e7b-53f9-4a94-b416-81e21953eae5)


**Question 6**

Write the SQL query that achieves the selection of the "cust_name" and "city" columns from the "customer" table (aliased as "c"), and the "ord_no," "ord_date," and "purch_amt" columns from the "orders" table (aliased as "o"), with a left join on the "customer_id" column and a condition filtering for customers in the city 'London'.
